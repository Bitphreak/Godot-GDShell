# Default Command List

This article is a list of default commands. Each command has its own article explaining syntax, flags, and usage. All commands are subject to change.

<!--
  - Your README.md says you are trying to mimic the feel of BASH, so
  - I am trying to make them in line with that, but feel free
  - to change any you feel could be better!
  -->

Command arguments in brackets `()` are optional, arguments in `{}` are sometimes required, in `<>` are always required. This article does not exaustively list the arguments, only the basic ones. 

The following are **curently implemented** in some way or another: 
- [`gdfetch`](gdfetch.md): Prints basic project information to the terminal. 
- [`man`](man.md): Prints manual info about the command specified.
- [`echo`](echo.md): Prints back the string passed in.
- [`clear`](clear.md): Clears the terminals text. 
- [`bool`](bool.md): Sets a boolean value in code.
