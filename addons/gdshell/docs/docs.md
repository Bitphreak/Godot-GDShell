# FAQ
**- Can I use GDShell in my project?**

Yes! You can use GDShell in any kind of project - free or commercial.<br>
The ONLY condition is to credit the GDShell creators in your project according to MIT license.

---

**- Can I use GDShell in a non-game project?**<br>

Yes you can! Debug consoles can come in handy with any kind of project.<br>
The GDShell usage is consistent between game and non-game projects.

---

**- Why is GDShell made with GDScript and not C#?**<br>

GDShell is made with GDScript so that both Standard and Mono versions of Godot can easily run GDShell.

---

**- Can I use C# with GDShell?**<br>

Not yet, but a C# wrapper is on it's way. If this is something that interests you, consider contributing to GDShell.<br>
Until then, you can use [Cross language scripting](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/scripting/cross_language_scripting.html) as a workaround.
